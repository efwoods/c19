## What I know from https://www.dictionary.com/e/what-are-antibodies-and-do-they-kill-viruses/

- c19 is a pathogen
- immunity is indicated by the presence of antibodies
- antibodies are protein molecules produced by the immune system produced by the immune system in response to antigens
    - how are antibodies produced
    - what produces antibodies
- antigens are pathogens
- antibodies latch on to antigens using a unique bonding site
  - what is the name of this site
  - do the antibodies fit the antigen shape?
- antibodies are made by "B cells" aka "B lymphocytes"
- B cells are made in the marrow and found in the blood and lymph
- Antibodies have a distinctive "Y" shape which is key to how they work
- at the tips of antibodies are unique sites where they bind with a matching site on antigens and destroy them
  - what makes this site unique?
  - how does the antibody bond with the antigen?
  - why and how are the antigens destroyed by the antibody?
  - what is the defining structure of an antibody that destroys a common flu antigen?
  - what is the defining structure of the common flu antigen?
- antibodies (Ab) are also called immunoglobulins (Ig) and are found in the plasma of blood and certain cell membranes
- there are five types of Ig defined by location and function (see link above)
- IgG and IgM are the key players in terms of warding off infectious diseases...

## What needs to happen

### Phase 1

- [ ] Identify a common known antibody/antigen pair such that the antibody destroys the antigen
- [ ] define the structure and characteristics of the antibody
- [ ] define the structure and characteristics of the antigen
- [ ] define the structure and characteristics of the cell in the bone marrow that produces the antibody
- [ ] define a target antigen to destroy
- [ ] simulate the antibody
- [ ] simulate the antigen
- [ ] simulate the modification and creation of the antibody
- [ ] observe the effect of the mutant antibody on the target antigen
- [ ] repeat simulation of the modification, creation, and effect of the antibody until the desired structure of the antibody is identified
- [ ] define the structure of the bone marrow cells required to create the mutated antibody
- [ ] define the steps needed to modify the antibody using CRISPR

### Phase 2

- modify existing antibodies to form to the target antibody structure (using CRISPR)
- modify marrow using CRISPR

### Phase 3
- test on a small controlled real world sample
- scale to production
